# Batch Script for Opening File Explorer

This batch script allows you to open File Explorer at a specified directory path.

## Installation

To be able to run the script from any directory without specifying its full path, you can add the directory containing the script to your system's PATH environment variable:

1. **Find the Script Directory**: Find the directory where you saved the `open.bat` script.

2. **Open System Environment Variables**: Search on windows 'Edit environment variables for your account' and open it.

3. **Edit PATH Variable**: In the 'Environment Variables' window, click on the 'Path' Variable and select 'Edit'.

4. **Add Script Directory**: Click on 'New' and paste the path to the directory containing the script (`open.bat`). Click 'OK' to close each window.

5. **Verify Installation**: Open a new Command Prompt window and type `open` followed by a directory path to ensure it works globally.

Now you can run the script from any directory without specifying its full path.

## Usage

You can use `open` + `path`.

> [!TIP]
> You can use absolute and relative navigation!

## Different operating systems
